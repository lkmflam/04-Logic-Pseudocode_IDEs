greater-than, less-than, equal to, not equal to, greater-than or equal to, less -than or not equal to
4.6 Write a pseudocode If-Then statement that assigns 0 to x if y is equal to 20.
If y == 20then
  set x = 0
endif
4.7 Write a pseudocode If-Then statement that assigns 0.2 to commission if sales is greater than or equal to 10,000.
If sales >= 10000 then
   set comm = 0.2

4.9 What statement do you use in pseudocode to write a dual alternative decision structure?
If else
4.10 When you write an If-Then-Else statement, under what circumstances do the statements that appear between Else and End If execute?
When the condition is false
4.11 If the following pseudocode were an actual program, what would it display?
```
If "z" < "a" Then
   Display "z is less than a."
Else
   Display "z is not less than a."
End If
```
Z is not less than a 
4.12 If the following pseudocode were an actual program, what would it display?
```
Declare String s1 = "New York"
Declare String s2 = "Boston"
If s1 > s2 Then
   Display s2
   Display s1
Else
   Display s1
   Display s2
End If
```
Boston New York
4.13 How does a dual alternative decision structure work?

4.14 What statement do you use in pseudocode to write a dual alternative decision structure?

4.15 When you write an If-Then-Else statement, under what circumstances do the statements that appear between the Else clause and the End If clause execute?

4.16 Convert the following pseudocode to an If-Then-Else If statement:
```
If number == 1 Then
   Display "One"
   ElseIf number == 2 Then
      Display "Two"
   ElseIf number == 3 Then
      Display "Three"

4.17 What is a multiple alternative decision structure?

4.18 How do you write a multiple alternative decision structure in pseudocode?

4.19 What does the case structure test, in order to determine which set of statements to execute?

4.20 You need to write a multiple alternative decision structure, but the language you are using will not allow you to perform the test you need in a Select Case statement. What can you do to achieve the same results?

4.21 What is a compound Boolean expression?

4.22 The following truth table shows various combinations of the values true and false connected by a logical operator. Complete the table by circling T or F to indicate whether the result of such a combination is true or false.
